The Spread Toolkit (http://www.spread.org) is a computer software package
that provides a high performance group communication system that is resilient
to faults across local and wide area networks. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_Toolkit)

This project is a simple client that connects to a Spread daemon, joins a
number of groups, and emits an event for each message received.
