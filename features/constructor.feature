Feature: Constructor
  As a developer of the Spread Toolkit for Node.js
  I want to increase test code coverage.

#  Scenario: Constructor is called without new
#    Given the Spread Toolkit for Node.js
#     When the constructor is called without using new
#     Then a new instance is returned

#  Scenario: One chucnk contains multiple payloads.
#    Given the Spread Toolkit for Node.js
#     When the constructor is called using new
